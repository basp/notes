# Bye bye Monad
Msh, Mush and Microsoft Command Shell are no more. Monad has a new *marquee* name 
and we all have the Microsoft marketing department to thank for it. Please say hello 
to the awfully named PowerShell and please try not to mess-up the carpet while you get 
sick looking at the changes.

Bah.

“Msh” or “Microsoft Command Shell” already did it for me; “PowerShell” just sounds 
too cheap and easy for me. I guess I’ll just have to keep calling it “Monad”. I can 
only hope Jeffrey and his team we’re as appalled as I was when I heared the news.

By the way, PowerShell is already a terminal emulator for X11.
