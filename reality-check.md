# Reality Check

# Where are we?
We're slowly peeking into the fabric of our existance. Lots of scientsists 
have been laboring extensively in order to find out why and how. Research is
still going as I write this and I expect more conclusive results and a more
general acceptance over the next 100 years.

# Our God
There's literally millions of gods. Some people believe in other gods than 
I do. That's fine. I'm sure a lot of *true* believers all over the world will
be offended by this statement. That's fine as well - rest assured I'm just
as annoyed by you guys believing in some 2000+ year old hipster (or even worse:
story) that's gonna save us all just by *believing* in him.

To me the whole religion thing seems like putting on blinders and singing kumbaya
until magic pink unicorns fly down from the sky to take you to never-never land.

Sorry, in that case I lean towards the scientific communcity who certainly don't 
always have things right but at least try to make a genuine effort to search
for our true god. In that way, they are more religious than any religious person
I know. And why would any god give us these capabilities to reason and think 
and expect us not to use them to our fullest extent? What kind of miserable god
is that?

# The Human Virus
Why did our so called gods tell us to go hither and be plenty? Because each
and every one is replacable and if we reall reflect deeply we can conclude 
no other thing than that, indeed, we are a virus upon the earth.
