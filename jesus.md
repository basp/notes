# Prelude
This is gonna be very blunt. In this essay I will argue that **Jezus** is **NOT** the son of *God* as we would like him to be. I will also argue that in his heart he didn't lie - he was in a certain perspective **the** son of *God*.

This essay is an objective view on how we perceive history and religion. I respect everones feelings, hopes and wishses and I don't wanna crush them but this text might be more revealing than you would like if you are deeply religious. In that case if you still want to read it I suggest to read it from on open mind. The last thing I want to point out is **personal** faults. Everything that I'm gonna describe has to be viewed in the right perspective andc I might be blunt but only in that frame of perspective.

Enjoy the rant!

# Intro
Sometimes the question about religion comes up. I'm raised a catholic but I quickly abandonded my faith once I started to think for myself.

Even though I was and still am fascinated by the history I felt everybody just got it all wrong.

* At some point science and relegion are basically the same thing. You make up rules for things you don't know how to explain.
* I realized the scientists where a lot more thorough and open in their work than the church.
* I don't like secrecy - I wanna know how things behave.

This all led me to believe that *the church* (whatever your church, can be science) doesn't really matter.
