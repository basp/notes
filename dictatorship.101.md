## THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO BECOMING A DICTATOR
Hello dear reader!

As the writer of this lengthy document, I guarantee you that you will be satisfied with all the insights that this guide has to offer. 

Also I can assure you the above claim is certainly true if you do no research anything for yourself. It will will probably not be true if you research on your own. If, at this point, we are still on the same page then I will fee comfortable to tell you that you might discover at least a small bit of enjoyment out of putting the effort into reading the next sections.  

As a warning, if you are reading this paragraph on a dodgy site that offers works on the creative license for a fee, and if you are one to contemplate whether you should go ahead and buy the rest off this text even though your gut feeling says it might be a dodgy site? Then I will be the first one to encouage you to do so. While you do so I will write the next paragraph and hope you realize your folly when reading that. But, rather seriously, please read a bit further first.

Whatever you do, please do not ever ever ever pay somebody money or give out any details to read this full text. This text is always available, *in full* at [TODO: insert public location] for no charge, free, in text (markdown) format). 

And if it's not there, then if it should ever become relevant enough, it will be available in other places.

> This is more general, *think* about things before you do them.

Clearly if you, at one point, believed my sarcastic advice above, you, my good sir or madam need some schooling in what and what not to do on the interwebs and maybe even in general. 

Don't ever go do something when people say you should do so. Have you no mind of your own? Can't you *think*? I apologize if I insulted you, dear reader, but for all that is holy - when you do something, it really helps to consider, what exactly it is you are about to do, beforehand and more importantly *why* you exhibit the target behaviour.

However you have come to the right place. I am going not only show you a thing about becoming a dictator (which mind you, is always useful) but I am going to show you a thing about actually thinking, figuring things out and having an opinion as well. Now how grand is that? I'm sure you're stoked, I know I am. Let's get cracking, shall we?

## the road ahead
Let's face it - it's a very slim chance you become a dictator overnight. It will take a lot of effort and persistence. However, the important thing is to realize that it can be done. 

No matter what kind of governement type you are dealing with, there's always ways around that. Also don't worry if you're not popular or attractive, those are not requirements for the job. Everyone can be a dictator. The important thing is willpower and stamina. And also a bit of luck and patience.

> If you can see it you can make it. The power of visualisation and imagination is more powerful than most people can imagine.

I don't claim this essay to be accurate. I do claim it to be accurate as far as my limited understanding of things allows it to be. In other words, I might very well be wrong about anything I write in this. 

It is my humble request to the reader of this possibly long winded essay that he or she keep an open mind and consider my ramblings as they are, the ramblings of somebody who just has a general desire to understand things and might very well be wrong in his hypotheses on a number of subjects in which he clearly has no credence.

## introduction 
> [TODO: from here on more serious and to the point]
It will amaze you how often and easily people are manipulated and coaxed into something they might not even dream to consider until it is too late. Lots of complete books have been written about this so I am going to focus on a particular pattern that has recently become worryingly more frequent: the dictatorship pattern, henceforth known as "the pattern".


## the pattern
It will take this whole paper to investigate a (for me) satisfying number of aspects of this pattern in order to gain a complete understanding but before we dive in we can at least take a look at a birds-eye view of the pattern and not worry too much about the details (which we *will* cover later). 

It all starts when (often a relative outsider) gets into a position where he or she can actively manipulate his or her own *power position* which, I agree, is not a very elegant way of describing the situation. Let's try with an example.

## an example
There is this hypothetical country, let's call it *Anubia* and say it has a total population of about a 100M (that's a hundred million) people. Which is a reasonable size for a country. 

> In fact, by some standards we would consider this a fairly substantial country in the global scheme of things.

Now, as is happening for at least 2000 years people tend to migrate to cities. People generally *conglomerate* and that is one of the most important things to keep in mind going forward. 

> If you do not believe that large masses of people naturally have a tendency to *conglomerate* I fear the whole hypotheses is wrong.

> [TODO: this whole quote is more or less some side notes]
> When I talk about *power* we are talking about the power to influence reality. The power to bend reality to your will. This is not some supernatural gift although some people are more gifted compared to others in regard to natural "power". This not easily quantifiable attraction is what is knows as *charisma* and it helps a lot.

However, even though people *do* conglomerate (cities) there''s still this strong sense of individualism. 

> From a certain angle, at a certain level, the whole individualism thing is a contradiction in human development. At a certain level we *do* tend and want to live near eachoother but on another level we don't really (imagine how many neighbour feuds are due to this!).

Actually this whole thing is interesting to look especially for an aspiring dictator so let's start with that. How many and what kind of people do we need to start up our operation?

## your inner circle
Let us face it - it is pretty hard to go at it alone. It *is* doable but more often than not you need the help of other trustworthy (easily manipulated) people (without a spine). 

So at some point you'll probably want at lest one or two people to assist you in various duties even before you get power. I like to use family members for this but close friends work equally well. 

> People power can be exponential if you manange to channel it well. Of course, it will perform equally and relatively worse when not channeled well.




## notes
- How is the pattern possible in a democracy?
- What does the pattern look like?
- What does it take to bootup/ignite (what goes on *before*)
- How is it fueled/maintained?
- What is charisma?
