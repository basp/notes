I might love writing words a bit too much 
I feel like my stuff always ends up maybe a tad too much 
I just start with this basic fact but then at some point it gets boring while proofreading it over again and again... 
So then I think: "wait, I could fit these words in here to make it more interesting"" 
And sometimes I wend up going on a complete tangent and end up with three paragraphs of stuff that makes sense but have no place at all in the thing I was trying to write in the first place... 
wind* 
And then you get some fucking good idea popping up and you just have to write it down because otherwise surely you won't remember it in 5 minutes.... 
And then you write and write and write and fuck man it's brillliant you think 
And you write some more and some more and sweet holy baby christ this is the most amazing idea ever...!!! 
And then you read it the next day and it makes no fucking sense at all 
And *that* my good people is when you are properly stoned. 
when you realize you got proper stoned*
