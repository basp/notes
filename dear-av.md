# Dear Av
You shouldn't read this like a love letter. It's not that. It's just that I *do* miss you in a very serious way. You've been a big part of my life for quite a while and I *do* notice I sometimes feel a bit lost without you.

# You're fab!
Ok let me first say you absofuck#$2amazingly fab. No other way around it. I think you'll mnanage in a lot of pools whether you like it or not. 

Considering how fabulous you are it's no surprise I wanna bask in your greatness. If you're curioous how great that is: "it's fucking amazing greatly great in a great kind of way."
