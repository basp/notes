# Erlang
Amongst all the big functional languages, Erlang is a weird beast. It definitely feels more lispy than ocamly due to it's dynamic typing. It runs in a VM and often feels like more like a small OS than a programming language. As you're often tweaking a live system on the go it strangely feels like Smalltalk sometimes as well. 

It's definitely funky though.

# Programming in Erlang
In Erlang you often have to resort to the (excellent) documentation to find out how to do stuff. There's not really something like intellisense to guide you.

However when you get into it and things start to fall together you realize the beauty of it all. The trick is to confine your problem space and tackle it bit by bit untill you have enough small bits to tackle the whole cleanly and nicely.
