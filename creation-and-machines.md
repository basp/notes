# Creation & Machines
How do creation and machines connect? 

A **machine** suggests some kind of repetative job that can easily be described by a series of steps. An algorithm. Creation suggests freedom and the opposite of what a machine can seemingly accomplish. However, the two are intimately involed as we will explore further.

# Creation
A **machine** is an automaton of creation. Before there can be machines we have to create. Before we **automate** we have to besure what exactly it is we are creating. So creation is the **primary** driving force.

Once we start to create many similar things we start to notice patterns. And when we identify such pattern we think about ways to **automate** it. We have to note that this is a very basic and simple way of thinking but it **does** make up a large part of our day to day work and often is not so simple as we would like due to *side effects* of the system.
