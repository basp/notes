# Stalls
* A stall is a situation when a plane basically falls down from the sky.
* A stall is caused because there is no more airflow over the wings in order
to sustain *lift*.
* When you're in a stall, the wings are just *plowing* though the air and not 
generating any lift any more.

# The root
* From the start, the B737 is designed to sit low to the ground. This was a 
"feature" so that passengers could easily be loaded on the planes with basic
means.
* In order for a modern jet engine to be more efficient, it needs to have
a physically bigger engine.
* If the engines get bigger it will get harder and harder to fit them below the 
wings of an airplane that already sits low to the ground.

# The market
* Airbus was gaining market share with their new efficient A320neo.
* On top of that, moving from any other A320 to the A320neo required no
additional training for the pilots.
* Airlines *really* like it when they can replace planes with similar ones
that are cheaper to fly and require no additional training for their pilots.
* Boeing wanted a more efficient competitor fast and it made a lot of sense to
create a more efficient version of their most popular model.
* They also wanted that this plane behaved exactly like their previous model so
that there would be no additional pilot training required.
* And of course they also wanted to beat Airbus by offering an even more 
efficient plane.
* This would definitely make for an easy sell to airlines and it did. 
* Almost 400 737 MAX versions have been delivered and about 5000 more are 
ordered.

# The engines
* Boeing wanted more efficient engines on their 737 in order to compete with
the Airbus 320neo.
* This meant that the engines had to be bigger. In order to fit them unto the 
low plane, they moved them forward (towards the cockpit) and upward relative to 
the position they had been on previous models.
* Due to aerodynamic forces, all planes have a tendency to pitch when there is
more thrust produced by the engines. 
* This effect is more pronounced with the B737 MAX engine placement versus the 
previous models.

# The body
* The body of the plane was longer relative to the previous model as well.

# A trim system
* Except for some relics, all aircraft have a *trim* system.
* Trimming is a way to *fine-tune* the control surfaces of an aircraft so that
it can fly stable in its operating conditions.
* Any certified commercial aircraft has to be *aerodynamically stable*.
* This basically means that you can trim it in such a way that it will continue
its course without any input from the (auto)pilot.
* Trim systems also help relieve the pilots.
* Trim systems are essential for the auto pilot since they provide fine grained
control.

# Stabilizer trim
* Larger aircraft generally have something that is called a *stabilizer trim*.
* This is a trim system that has control over the complete stabilizer instead of
just some trim surfaces.
* The stabilizer is the horizontal wing on the tail of a plane.

# The testing
* It's unclear wether the aerodynamical problems with the 737MAX (due to its
new engine configuration and body) were known before actual flight testing.
* However, at some point Boeing found out that the 737MAX didn't really *feel*
enough like a 737NG.

# The MCAS
* At some point, Boeing designed the **MCAS** system to make the 737MAX *feel* 
exactly like a 737NG.

# Please note that
* The MCAS system is not a safety device.
* It's not designed to "prevent" stalls.
* The sole purpose of the MCAS system is to make sure any 737NG certified pilot 
is able to fly the 737MAX.

# The AoA sensor
* In essence, the *angle-of-attack* or *AoA* sensor measures how the plane is 
*attacking* the air resistance that makes it fly.
* It gives the pilots some indication how air is flowing over the wings which
is useful in order to prevent a *stall*.
* There are two of these sensons on the 737MAX.
* There is an optional package you can buy that has a warning indicator mounted
on the dashboard in case the sensors *disagree* with eachother.
* AoA sensors disagreeing with each other is not a terribly serious problem.
* That's why the warning light feature **is not** a safety option. It's a luxury 
option.
* AoA sensors might sound like high tech devices but they are seriously low tech
in their physical implementation.
* An AoA sensor is usually physically implemented as a small vane that is
mounted on a wheel that is connected to some software.
* A multiple of these (two in the case of a B737MAX, one on each wing) are
then usually mounted on the wings of the aircraft.
* This vane will then turn into the wind and cause the wheel that it is mounted
on to rotate certain amount of degrees. This is the angle of attack.

# The FAA
* Drained of money and without expertise they handed over more and more power
to Boeing during the certification process.
