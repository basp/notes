# The root
* From the start, the B737 is designed to sit low to the ground. This was a 
"feature" so that passengers could easily be loaded on the planes with basic
means.
* In order for a modern jet engine to be more efficient, it needs to have
a physically bigger engine.
* If the engines get bigger it will get harder and harder to fit them below the 
wings of an airplane that already sits low to the ground.

# The market
* Airbus was gaining market share with their new efficient A320neo.
* On top of that, moving from any other A320 to the A320neo required no
additional training for the pilots.
* Airlines *really* like it when they can replace planes with similar ones
that are cheaper to fly and require no additional training for their pilots.
* Boeing wanted a more efficient competitor fast and it made a lot of sense to
create a more efficient version of their most popular model.
* They also wanted that this plane behaved exactly like their previous model so
that there would be no additional pilot training required.
* And of course they also wanted to beat Airbus by offering an even more 
efficient plane.
* This would definitely make for an easy sell to airlines and it did. 
* Almost 400 737 MAX versions have been delivered and about 5000 more are 
ordered.

# The engines
* Boeing wanted more efficient engines on their 737 in order to compete with
the Airbus 320neo.
* This meant that the engines had to be bigger. In order to fit them unto the 
low plane, they moved them forward (towards the cockpit) and upward relative to 
the position they had been on previous models.
* Due to aerodynamic forces, all planes have a tendency to pitch when there is
more thrust produced by the engines. This effect is more pronounced with the 
B737 MAX engine placement versus the previous models.

# The body
* The body of the plane was longer relative to the previous model as well.

# The FAA
* Drained of money and without expertise they handed over more and more power
to Boeing during the certification process.
