Heya Zita! Hogy vagy?

You know me, I gotta apologize for taking so long to write a substantial message. Please, accept my apologies, here are the excuses; what follows is basically a long ranting tale of sorrow but it ends on a high note. Promised!

## Note 1
It's weird, I postponed writing you for such a long time and now I feel like an ocean of words is waiting to be typed. Also I felt especially guilty about not
responding properly since you *nudged* me a month or two ago.

## Note 2
Hopefully you don't mind me doing it this way, I really can't stand the limited e-mail format anymore. If this doesn't work for you please let me know.

# The stuff (you might not) wanna hear
Since I've committed to a long rambling text anyway I might as well get this out of the way. 

I still *love* you but not so much in a romantic desire but like a very precious friend. The English language allows for fairly liberal use of the word "love" so hopefully you don't blame me too much for using it. I hate using the concept of "platonic love" but I guess that is pretty close.

See I told you this was gonna be rambling, hope you have some time and a drink or two!

I cannot deny I had a hard time letting go of you. Sorry if that is too blunt but it *is* the truth. I think in the end I managed to do it though it took longer than I expected. 

I do see now how I was so overly obsessed. It really was hard to **not** think about you. Heck, it could be almost seen as harrasment and that was the last thing I had in mind. Still though, reflecting on that period I can't help to seek for where I went wrong and I've found plenty since then.

It amazes me that you even could stand me for all that time.

# About me
## Overview
Since I promised you a long rambling post I figure I might as well diverge a bit. I don't think anything in this section will be a surprise but to me it feels good to write it down anyway.

So yeah, when it comes to women I'm a complete and utter fail for as long as I can remember. It's a thing and I'm not sure what causes it. Sometimes I think I should just be a monk instead. I don't meet many new women. Hardly. I don't really go look for them either.

I'm prety sure it's not that I love men instead, at least not according to how my instruments work it seems. However, I do have issues and sadly you have been confronted with them as well in various forms. I regret that very much.

## The meat and bones
I didn't lie. This is gonna be reasonably long. You better still like reading!

To be honest, even though we spent a bit of time together I don't think we really know each other very well and hopefully this rambling will at least fix part of it.

* There's 4 years between me and my only brother
* Very spoiled for most of my life
* Used to slam my head into a table as a child when I was frustrated
* Prone to addiction
* Don't think it caused any mental damage but who knows
* Like to know how things work and *fit together* (no pun)
* Sucker for looks and material stuff (vanity)
* In everything; causes a lot of problems
* Either too blunt or too shy
* Short term memory is hopeless
* Clueless with women... Or did I mention that already?

On the other hand I do like to think I have some reedeeming qualitiies as well:

* I'm a knowledge predator
* I can't stand *magic* (have to know how it works)
* I can empathize with people as well as animals
* I tend to stand in the back of the line but when someone pushes ahead in the queue then I get *really* angry

And most importantly:
* I do stuff. Just do it. If things go wrong? Just say sorry and move on. People only learn when they kick down stuff and learn where the boundaries are. If it feels right, just do it (fuck you Nike). 

Also thanks to you I've learned that, sometimes, just let go and do and not worry.

In other words, I like to think I'm quite humble and empathizing and I can't stand lying and make belief. Also I'm not sure why I'm telling and bullet-pointing all this like I'm making some kind of business presentation but somehow it does feel good to just ramble. Hopefully the reading is not too awful.

I'll always be worrying but you have taught me a glimpse of what it is to not worry about a thing. Looking back on it now, the time spent with you is like a dream more than a memory. And I don't wanna make that sound bigger than it is. But it is. And it is the truth. 

And yeah I do realize we might not be the best fit, damn, I kinda realized that quite early but I didn't want to give up on you and hoped it would work anyway, somehow. Sadly it didn't and I was sad but not too surprised and I don't blame you at all. If someone deserves blame it is me and not anybody else. 

And don't get me wrong, I'm not obsessing or antyhing but I do still consider our time spent together as a huge influence on the rest of my life. And hopefully you can accept me being blunt about my feelings. I think I'm quite over matters right now but that doesn't mean I cannot (hopefully) objectively reflect on the time we spent.

I can totally see how it might not be like that for you though and if that's the case that's awesome! Always believe in yourself and only yourself! You always were experienced and confident. People don't get anywhere if they are not blunt and honest. And I always appreciated you for that.

And I just felt like lost boy. Amazed by everything he sees. To be honest I kinda dig that role, I like learning and being amazed. I try to see wondere where maybe other people might not see it. It's one of the things that keeps me going. I like mysteries, life is a mystery to me and I hope I can figure it all out before I die. That's the challenge. 

And heaven? Meh, I think I don't I'll experience such heaven anymore. I've been in heaven. It was unexpectly quite nearby and I met an awesome person there. A person that I think about every day. That I don't want to bother too much and then end up neglecting her. I found heaven with her I think a few times.

## The lady

The lady (and I'm still not sure if she was there to clean or spy on us) and the way it all felt right that first night.

I don't think I ever felt better than those few precious hours I got to spend with you in bliss.

The shamelessness.

The moments of silence just surfing along in thought. Smoking way too much cigarettes but who cares...

The crazy noise of the city that I wasn't used to at all. Sirenes everywhere.

A woman in my arms. I don't really know her but how does it feel so familiar... What is this crazy spell she cast on me?

Even more strange; it was weird, it was awesome, it was amazing.

It was everything and to me it was heaven.

# The sad stuff
As children of the 80's I think we both can agree it has been a sad year overall. Even though we migh or might not like them, a lot of heroes and heroines (especially in music) have been taken from us. For my, my mom was one of them.

I'm sure you're smart enough to know for a long time I'm a momma's boy. My mum was like a saint to me and I loved her like nothing else. 

Maybe a bit too much but let's talk about Freud some other time perhaps if you're interested.

Anyway, around May this year I started a new job at a hip design agency that was nearby where I live. It was a great job but in the end it didn't really work out.

About two or three weeks after I started there we got news that my mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer. A week later she passed away. 

After dealing with all that I kinda collapsed a bit. On top of that I had a few accidents so I was immobile for a while as well. So that was a rough start to begin with. On top of that, turns out getting to the job site (even though it's nearby)  is quite a hassle (I still need to figure out how rivers cause traffic jams but I think it has to do with trucks slowing down going up the ramp).

Anyway, it was a hassle to get there and even though the job was pretty good it didn't really suit me.

# The good stuff
Luckily though, after a few months of depression I finally got over it, got a good amount of money to chill for a bit and *really* look for a suitable job. And I think I found it. It's nearby, I felt right at home since first stepping into the office and I'm actually looking forward to going to work just because of the awesome people I get to work with.

On top of that it seems that my brother is going to work there as well with is awesome because that means we can carpool and all my transportation worries are instantly solved (it's only a 10 minute drive).

# Final notes
The year 2016 has been pretty shitty but it seems to end on a high note. I would love to actually speak to you in person as friends but I'm not sure if you are up for that. I like Hungary and would have no problem coming over there not only to speak to you but also to because it feels exotic and familiar at the same time. 

# PS
Take care and I hope you had a better 2016 than I did... 

# PS2
Any plans for New Year? I'm on bootcamp on the last Friday and Thursday of this year but I would fly over anywhere after that if you wanna meetup.
