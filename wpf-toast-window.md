# Let's create a WPF *toast* window!
In this short tutorial we'll design a nice and reusable toast window that we can just plugin wherever we need it in a WPF application. Along the way we'll hopefully learn a thing or two about WPF and Windows programming in general.

## Getting started
I recommend using a WPF application project template to start out with. Although it is actually really easy to bootstrap a WPF application manually this template gives us the option of creating new `Window` classes easily which will come in handy for this tutorial.
