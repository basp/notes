# History
It all started when we got a C64 at some point. I loved that thing and I especially loved typing on it. Just interacting with it.

    OK.
    > PLOP YOU COMPUTER!
    SYNTAX ERROR.

The thing had a tape drive and a notebook with the indexes of where every program *would* be. If you're lucky. Turns out the program is never at `163` or `164` but almost certainly somewhere in between. This meant that if I wanted to run **A** you would:

1. Lookup the index of **A** in the hand written notebook of the previous owner.
2. Hope you'll find it quickly
3. Seek to the position on the tape.
4. Try to run it 
5. Get an error
6. Seek forward a little bit and try again
7. Repeat until it runs

Eventually me and my dad got sick of it and for some reason we didn't bother to invest in a disk drive - I was eight at the time and my dad wasn't *that* much into the home computer market anyway so I don't blame him.

Eventually though, thanks to my mom being a secretary in the neighborhood council we got ourselves a 8086 with glorious Hercules graphics (monochrome "hires" stereotypical green-black). It had trouble running games because well Hercules but there were some I could run. 

I remember mostly playing around with Banner and WordPerfect 5.1 in those days. Learned that dumping every file in `C:\` is a bad idea (thanks previous owner) and some funky stuff you could do with `.bat` files. Eventually I ended up writing *menus* for family and friends in the form of `.bat` scripts because nobody really knew what to do when they ended up at the `C:\>` prompt.

A few years later we finally got a real computer of our own, a 386DX40 and I got some good use out of that thing. That was also when I encountered so called *demos* which the rest of this will mostly be about.

# Demos
What do I mean? A *demo* as considered here is a piece of software that is intended to show off the skills of one or more people. Those skills usually relate to programming, music and art (the three skills that are important to create games in particular).

Most demos are created by a group of people. Usually three of more where you have a programmer, an artist and a composer. It's not uncommon that some people can perform in multiple roles.

Some of these early crews have grown to big companies by now (DICE for example) and some of the names exist for more than 30 years now (Fairlight) but I don't think the original crew is still the same. A lot of them started out as so called *crackers* that made it their mission to find ways to bypass the digital security around video games at that time.

Here's a reasonably short example of a somewhat modern demo.

**Assembly** is the biggest demo party (or at least the most legendary) and it's held in Helsinki each year. That's also why I'm going to visit that city later this year, after years of longing I'll finally be visiting.

# TODO
* Personal efforts
* General about demos and how progging, visuals and music fit together
