# History
It all started when we got a C64 at some point. I loved that thing and I especially loved typing on it. Just interacting with it.

    OK.
    > PLOP YOU COMPUTER!
    SYNTAX ERROR.

The thing had a tape drive and a notebook with the indexes of where every program *would* be. If you're lucky. Turns out the program is never at `163` or `164` but almost certainly somewhere in between. This meant that if I wanted to run **A** you would:

1. Lookup the index of **A** in the hand written notebook of the previous owner.
2. Hope you'll find it quickly
3. Seek to the position on the tape.
4. Try to run it 
5. Get an error
6. Seek forward a little bit and try again
7. Repeat until it runs

Eventually me and my dad got sick of it and for some reason we didn't bother to invest in a disk drive - I was eight at the time and my dad wasn't *that* much into the home computer market anyway so I don't blame him.

Eventually though, thanks to my mom being a secretary in the neighborhood council we got ourselves a 8086 with glorious Hercules graphics (monochrome "hires" stereotypical green-black). It had trouble running games because well Hercules but there were some I could run. 

I remember mostly playing around with Banner and WordPerfect 5.1 in those days. Learned that dumping every file in `C:\` is a bad idea (thanks previous owner) and some funky stuff you could do with `.bat` files. Eventually I ended up writing *menus* for family and friends in the form of `.bat` scripts because nobody really knew what to do when they ended up at the `C:\>` prompt.

A few years later we finally got a real computer of our own, a 386DX40 and I got some good use out of that thing. That was also when I encountered so called *demos* which the rest of this will mostly be about.

# Demos
What do I mean? Here's a reasonably short example.
