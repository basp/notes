# the magic of code
It is easy to be impressed when you are young. I was impressed by software in a big way. In this essay I will hopefully convey some of those impressions but also look at some of the downsides that can come with such passion. In addition to that, I hopefully make a point that the concept of *code* is accessible to everyone.

## programming is magic
Being a programmer is a bit like being a wizard they say. Some programmers (or their coworkers) might even call them wizards but code is nothing to be scared of. The first thing that is problematic is the fact that we call it *code* like it's some kind of incomprehensible thing. Those days are long gone unless you're operating in very specialized areas and then you probably know what you're doing.

Nowadays most of the code is pretty friendly, or at least *should* be.
