It is every easy to invade the US but we have to do it via cultural means. Lots of people across the pond look up to the "ancient land" and especially the more progressive people start to look up to us. 

Europe as a whole is not a very concrete entity but there are governements in place that can make it act as a sort of identity. Whatever the concept of Europe might mean, it has an identity but it is generally not prominent in world politicts. This is fine and does not have to change.

See what a video such like Henk Poort & Floor Jansen's version of Phantom of the Opera can do. And they are an espcially remarkable example since it combines Dutch "exports" such as Henk Poort and Floor Jansen but also the remarkable talent of her band Nightwish with Finnish composer (TODO insert name).

There's a long way before we reach star trek.
