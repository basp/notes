# Caught in Between
## A small bit of history
Intel is a staple of US industry and has lead at the forefront of IC development for decades. Market pressure on the company is mounting and this essay will outline a few important reasons why this is.

Traditionally, Intel is heavily invested into research and development. This is out of necessity but also out of oppurtunity since for quite a while, Intel was pretty dominant in imporant segments of the market. In this era, it was pretty normal to design *and* produce your own chips.

Designing chips is not exactly easy. Producing them is a lot more difficult. Now, at first this wasn't too bad as chips were pretty basic and people were getting used to the tools (i.e. the machines used to fabricate chips). I'd guess that at the very first beginnnings, a working chip was considered a huge success. Even if it was a bit buggy and slow.

As humans do, we don't stop there though. Once we have something that works the more commerciallly savvy persons will try find a way to scale it up in order to meet economies of scale (as it it nowadays called).

## How do we print chips?
So how do we actually make these things? Well, nobody really knows. That's not a lie. Well it might be a slight lie but there's not many people that 100% know how to make chips. A lot of people know how to make parts of a chips but the complete thing? That info is skilfully distributed.
