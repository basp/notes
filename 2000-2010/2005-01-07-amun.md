# Posted on Friday 7 January 2005
Amun is a basic SQL sandbox. It is designed to be a reasonably friendly
and safe environment (hopefully in the future - at this point you can 
do pretty much everything your database allows) in which you can build 
and try out connection strings and SQL commands. One of my collegues 
tried out a previous version and I have seen him using it a few times so 
maybe it’s useful to other people too. It’ll will be a little bit longer though 
before I dare to release it to the public but I plan to do a lot of work on it 
this weekend.

# Note
In case you're wondering. We had to deal a lot with *Access* databases back
then and that query editor was just horrible to work with. So Amun was very
similar to SQL Server Manager in that it allowed you to query the database 
using a good font and text editor and a proper grid for results instead of that
Access nonsense. 

It used ADO to connect which meant it connect to a reasonably wide variety of 
datbases but the interface was very basic and to this day is very similar to SQL
Server Manager. Basically an object explorer, a query pane and an output pane
displaying either a grid of results of the output messages (usually implemented
with tabs).
