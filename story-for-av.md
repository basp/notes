# Story for Av
This doesn't deserve an intro. We must get right into the story. It will be a complex and challenging journey but it should be worth it.

# Story
As he walked there was a huge nothing in front of him. Behind him was his past. Two seperate worlds. And here he was in the *now* of all things. Not a pretty place to be be.

As he walked it started to dawn on him. He realized there had to be some kind of end to his journey. Travel is only a means to an end. And the end was missing.

# A journey to an end
A strawn rock offered a place for contemplation.

At first his thoughts were led ashtray... 

> Why is this rock here? 

But soon he realized his purpose.

The rock, that offered some kind of solace in his long journey also offered him insight. As he sat upon the rock he wondered why he could sit on that rock. And why the rock couldn't sit on him. And what is the fundamental thing that differentiates a rock from a person.
