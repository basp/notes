# New hire 001
Feeling like this might be a recurring section I have optimisticly labelled it with a `001` label. Not that I hope that *many* more will follow but that I fear at least *some* will.

Please team, correct me if I'm wrong but I think the workload we're currently getting is manageable even with the lot of incidents we have on a regular basis. Remember: our own damn fault!

That means we can start to increase our confidence and slowly start to tune our effort and hopefully the amount of work we take on (to eventuallly create more knowledge and money for the organization). If we can take the good things we are doing right now, home-in on them, focus and deal with alll the noise that interferes we are looking good. Very good indeed and *if* we can do that I'm sure we can even beat real-world nasty.

All that having said. I think most of us don't really need a new person in **our** team that we're so carefully building up. Not **right now**. Not now considering the *wave* that we're on. Then again, *the powers that be* might decide otherwise and we'll have to deal with it. It's too early to throw up arms just yet, we can only be professional about it; whatever happens.

Hope you don't mind me writing in English... Sometimes my thoughts just tend to flow better in English for one. Love you all.

Informally,

Bas
