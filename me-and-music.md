# From trombone to chiptunes
## History
It's very likely my mom and dad kinda pushed me in the way of music. Maybe because they wanted me to or maybe they knew I had some kind of talent for it. So I did the regular musical training. At that time, around the 90's lots of kids where still playing instruments in the local fanfare and bands so it was still a huge crowd.

When I was about 10 years old and finished basic training I could "choose" an instrument. To be honest, there was not much to choose from. My parents weren't particullary rich and also going through a bit of a rough time so they could not afford an instrument. That's why we had to lend one from the local harmony but that meant I had to play with and for them as well. So after graduating from wooden flute I more or less got the trombone even though I didn't really want to play it. It didn't interest me at all. I was more fascinated about how computer games worked at the time.

Still though, I picked it up and started practicing on it. It really helped that a close friend picked up the trombone in the same year so that made the choice easier once I learned that.

## Learning to <3 the trombone
Eventually I started to love the instrument. It wasn't especially pretty to play but it sure was a physical manifestation that grabbed interrest. Once I realized this I started investing in the intrument more. So for the next decade or so I really played the trombone to my best of abilities. I loved it and I always have hated it at the same time (it was clumsy, prone to having dents which made playing very uncomfortable and reasonly high maintance). It's the long sleek legged beauty of instruments. It has so much going for it thanks to it's wide reach and amazing *glide* capabilities. The typical sound which has unbelievable range and the versatility. 

It's a though love however and a high maintenance mistress. The slightest dent will ruin your experience playing the thing and if you regularly play in packed bars where people are drinking heavily that stuff is very likely to happen. Also you need to keep it greased up, keep it clean, change the rubbers, etc. In the end, the maintenance is what killed me because once you get a bit comfortable on it, it's a damn fine instrument and awesomely fun to play with live public (because it can be very spectacular especially if you have a few trombonists).

## Going electronic
I have a great passion for music, especially for electronic music, 80's style synth music and *chip tunes* in particular. I think this might be because of my fascination with software. I can remeber that sofware used to be magic to me. I have spent so long wondering as a kid how it all worked. How was it possible that a simple plastic cartridge plugged into a boxy device turned up such amazing wonders on my TV screen. I also remember it took me a lot of effort to finally figure it all out (especially since we had no internet and our encyclopedia was from 1970). I have to say the local library was kinda lame as well and it wasn't until I started to visit the city library around 13 years old that I found some useful books.

## Gaming
I remember my dad got us an C64 when I was 7/8 years old. Sadly I was unable to get much out of it at the time and eventually it was sold off against my will (I'm sure). Anyway I do remember that I somehow loved just typing in stuff and experimenting with the thing - it wasn't scary, just inviting. Even though they sold it off, I think my mom and dad did realize there was some potential.

When the NES came out it was a huge wonder. Everbody wanted one, the marketing was ever and ever more huge until basically everyone got a NES and some games for it. I remember telling my baseball friends about that my mom would get me a NES. They called me a liar. A month later I was one of the first (even before the rich kids I knew) to have an actual NES and some games to play. On top of that my mom drove me every few weeks over to a nearby town where we could *rent* games (pretty progressive for the time when the NES wasn't long out).

I loved the NES but not so much for it's games but for what it could do. To be honest - I wasn't ever much of a gamer, I just watched as my friend played the games my mum bought me and I was there to think about how it all worked and for the rest enjoy the show. Actually I have very little real "completions" even to this day.

But even then I kept on practicing and eventually did became good at least a few games which kept me going. And going and going.

## Programming
If you are desperate enough you search and search. So after a long while (years) I started to figure out how all the technology fitted together. I bought some very expesive and thick books about VGA/SVGA cards and also Assembly language and started to work. On the side I did some stuff in Pascal but my main focus eventually went to assembly language. I even forgot about how BASIC works even though I did a fair amount of work in that when around 14 years old.

So there I'm poking bytes straight into the video memory, writing my own Norton clone in Assembly and loving it. This period really helped me to grasp and understand what actually is necessary for the computer to perform something even as simple as blinking a cursor in the right place.
