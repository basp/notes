At some point, any succesful software house will end up with multiple customers who also might have multiple products and/or projects. The "team" in this case might be only one or two people or even the whole company might be one person. It doesn't matter because the growth process is more or less the same everytime.

Eventually, the *team* cannot manage all the work anymore. The first step is to grow the team. At first the growth tends to go slowly enough so that not much productivity is lost (if any). Most of the code is still being written by a few people who usually work so closely together that they think alike or at least their code follows mostly the same patterns.

At some point though, if success continues, the team will have grown so fast that it becomes hard to manage. Or sometimes the team itself may indicate the desire for a split. In rare cases the team actually decides to split up without management intervention. Now things start to become interesting.

# you're rambling
Yes but it's important rambling. Without understanding why things usually are how they are it's hard to see how things could be better. If you only worked for one company it's sometimes easy to think that things are probably a whole lot better at other companies. Maybe they are better at software development or maybe they really get *Scrum* or some other hip framework.

The truth is, most teams struggle with *software development* (whatever your framework/process of choice) in much of the same ways for much of the same reasons as every other team that is bigger than 3 people. I found the real difference often lies in how the team itselfs handles hardships.

# one team, many customers
Eventually, a team will probably end up with multiple customers. And things will get hard to manage. Some of those customers might be into your process more than others. How do you reconcile the wishes of several customers into one scrum process? Should you even try? How do we deal with this?

First, it *can* work to a certain extend. I've seen it work but it can be complicated for lots of factors that actually have little to do with the technical side of software development.

The symptom is always the same: the development team lacks focus.

First, let me repeat that this is a **symptom** and often not a *cause* of the real problem. Although sadly, often the lack of focus *is* seen as the real problem. This makes it easy to place the blame on the development team and causes more issues as the root of the problem(s) are not seen, ignored or simply not taken care of. 

Second, there's often also lots of issues that can be directly attributed to the development team (but lack of focus can usually not be blamed on them).

> Nobody, not even the boss can directly request the development team to do something that might have an effect on the outcome of the sprint. The team made a real *commitment* with the prduct owner and that commitment is void when the PO is not involved. Only the PO can call any shots on this and if it involves changing the scope of the current sprint he or she should involve the development team.

A lack of focus is when somebody demands something be fixed immediately. Bypassing the whole process and directly involving one of the development team in a decision.




# kanban
Kanban could very well be a better model than scrum for any given team. But we should not use it as an excuse for "nothing matters" anymore. In that case we might as well call it *banzai* mode.

# deployment
Sadly we don't have the luxury of a magical green *make everything work* button that will make all our deployment wishes come true. And if we want to have some understand and control of our deployments I don't think that's a good goal to shoot for either (note CI and automated deployments are *very nice* but we should not overshoot and deprive ourselves of the knowledge and control needed to *dive into problems* when needed).
