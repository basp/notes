# Notes
This is my collection of notes and ramblings. I have to apologize 
for it's current state as it is very much unorganized at best. In 
here you'll find a few main things:

* Lot's of Python Notebooks on Math and sometimes Physics related stuff from.
* A (growing) collection of my old rambling from 2000-2010
* A quite rapid growing collection of new ramblings (this is my new blog basically).
* And maybe some hidden gems here and there (I'm not gonna spoil everything)

Note that you can view the `.pynb` files straight from the *github* website.
They are basically documents that contain Python script and fancy markup and 
GitHub will run them on your behalf and present the results so it's completely safe. They might take a few seconds to load though. 

# Preface
To be honest, this is currently the most valuable repo I have on GitHub right now. It contains a lot of random thoughts and insights that I've only started collecting in the last year or so. I can see this repo will grow quite fast as time goes by. I *do* eventually plan to organize it neatly but for now I like kinda like it the way it is. At least this way I don't have to think too much when I want to commit an idea, however bad the idea might be.

I try to write in an amusing way and at the same time that means that some of my pieces go nowhere at all. There's a lot of unfinished documents in here and I promise I will finish them one day... Someday. However, I like to think that whenever I commit a new object there should be at least something interesting in there. But sometimes I fail though. Please let me know when I do.

Have fun reading through my ramblings. Hope you get something out of it!
